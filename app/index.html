      <h2>All cicadas, all the time.</h2>
      <div class="fun-facts">
        <p class="fact">Some cicadas produce sounds up to 120 dB, which is loud enough to cause permanent hearing loss in humans should the cicada sing just outside the listener's ear!</p>
        <p class="fact">Some cicadas have very long lifetimes, emerging in prime cycles of 13 or 17 years in large numbers! A predator with a shorter life cycle of at least two years could not reliably prey upon the cicadas.</p>
        <p class="fact">Some small species have songs that are too high in pitch for humans to hear.</p>
        <p class="fact">Cicadas are eaten in various countries, including China where the nymphs are served deep-fried in Shandong cuisine. Yum!</p>
        <p class="fact">The adult cicada is around 2&ndash;5 centimetres in length.</p>
        <p class="fact">Only male cicadas produce the distinctive sound. Mating is tough!</p>
        <p class="fact">Cicadas sing most actively in hot weather and do their most spirited singing during the hotter hours of a summer day.</p>
        <p class="fact">Many species also have a distress call in addition to their mating call.</p>
        <p class="fact">Some species also have a courtship song, produced after a female  has been drawn by the calling song.</p>
        <p class="fact">Male cicadas also product <em>encounter calls</em> to maintain personal space.  Battle music, for bugs!</p>
        <p class="fact">Cicadas live most of their lives between 30&ndash;250 centimetres underground as <em>nymphs</em>.</p>
        <p class="fact">Cicadas can jump in less than 1 millisecond.</p>
        <p class="fact">Cicadas do not bite or sting, but may occasionally mistake a person's arm for a plant limb and attempt to feed.</p>

    <h1>So, what's a cicada?</h1>
    <p>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicada" title="Cicada on Wikipedia" target="_blank">wikipedia</a>: the Cicadoidea, cicadas (/sɪˈkɑːdə/ or /sɪˈkeɪdə/), are a superfamily of insects in the order Hemiptera, suborder Auchenorrhyncha (formerly part of the obsolete "Homoptera"), along with smaller jumping bugs such as leafhoppers and froghoppers. About 2,500 species of cicada have been described; there remain many undescribed species.</p>

    </div>
    <p>Cicadas have prominent eyes set wide apart, short antennae, and membranous front wings. They have an exceptionally loud song, produced not by stridulation but by vibrating drumlike tymbals rapidly. The earliest fossil Cicadomorpha appeared in the Upper Permian period; extant species occur all around the world in temperate to tropical climates. They typically live in trees, feeding on sap, and laying their eggs in a slit in the bark. Most cicadas are cryptic, singing at night to avoid predators. The periodic cicadas spend most of their lives as underground nymphs, only emerging after 13 or 17 years, most likely to reduce losses by satiating their predators.</p>
    <p>Cicadas have featured in literature since the time of Homer's Iliad, and as motifs in art from the Chinese Shang dynasty. They have been used in myths and folklore to represent carefree living and immortality. Cicadas are eaten in various countries, including China where the nymphs are served deep-fried in Shandong cuisine.</p>
    <p>The name is a direct derivation of the Latin cicada, meaning "tree cricket". American English of central Appalachia retains the name "jarfly".[1] In ancient Greek, it was called a tettix, and in modern Greek tzitzikas—both names being onomatopoeic.</p>
